## 1. ❓ Why Do We Need a Translator?

- **High-Level Languages**: Languages like Python, C, C++, and Java are easier for **humans** to understand.
- **Low-Level Language**: Computers only understand **binary language (0s and 1s)**.

### ➡️ Problem
- Humans write code in high-level languages.
- Machines **cannot** directly understand these languages.

### 🧩 Solution: Translator
- A **translator** converts high-level language to machine (binary) code.
- It bridges the communication gap between humans and machines.

### 📄 Types of Translators
- **Compiler** – covered in this presentation.
- **Interpreter** – will be covered in the next session.

## 2. 🧠 What is a Compiler?

### 🔍 Definition
> A **compiler** is a **complex software** that **converts source code to machine code in one go**.

- ✅ It is **software**, not hardware.
- ⚙️ Converts **entire code** at once to an **executable binary**.

---

## 📌 Example: C Program Compilation

### ✍️ Sample Code (Written on Developer's Machine)
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20, sum;
    sum = a + b;
    printf("%d", sum);
    getch();  // Keeps the screen open until a character is entered
    return 0;
}
```

### 💡 Why C Code?
- C is a **compiled language**, making it suitable for compiler demonstration.

---

## 🖥️ Compilation Process

### ✅ Step-by-Step:
1. Write C code (`sum.c`) in **Code::Blocks IDE**.
2. Click **Build** → Compiles the code.
3. Generates:
   - `sum.exe` – Executable file
   - `sum.o` – Object file (intermediate step, not used directly)

### 📂 Output Directory
- Both `.c` and `.exe` files are found in the **same folder** (e.g., `C Programs`).

### ⚠️ OS-Specific Executables
- Compiled on **Windows** → `.exe` file
- Compiled on **Mac** → `.app` file

➡️ Executables work **only on the OS** where they were compiled.

---

## 📤 Sharing Executable

- Once compiled:
  - You can **share the `.exe` file** with any other **Windows** machine.
  - No need to share or recompile the `.c` source code.
  
### 🧪 Output
- Double-click `sum.exe`
- Output shown: `30`
- Screen stays open until a key is pressed due to `getch()` function.

---

## 📝 Summary

- We need a **translator** because machines can't understand high-level code.
- A **compiler** converts entire source code to machine code **in one go**.
- The result is an **executable file** that runs on the same OS.
- **Compilation happens once**, and the executable can be run multiple times.
