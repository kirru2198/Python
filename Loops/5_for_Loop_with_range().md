**Presentation: Understanding `for` Loop with `range()` Function in Python**

Hello everyone,
In this presentation, we will learn about the `for` loop in Python using the `range()` function. So, without any further delay, let’s get started.

2. Using `for` loop with `range(stop)`
3. Using `for` loop with `range(start, stop)`
4. Using `for` loop with `range(start, stop, step)`
5. Key Points to Remember

### **1. Introduction to the `range()` Function**

The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers. It generates numbers based on the arguments provided to it.
> The range() function returns a sequence of numbers. It generates numbers based on the values you give it.

#### **Syntax:**

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

* **start** (optional): The beginning value of the sequence. Default is `0`.
* **stop** (required): The end value **(not included)** in the sequence.
* **step** (optional): The difference between each number in the sequence. Default is `1`.

#### **Example:**

```python
range(0, 5, 1)
```

This will generate:

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

If step is `2`:

```python
range(0, 5, 2)
```

This will generate:

```
0, 2, 4
```

So, the `range()` function returns a series of numbers based on the **start**, **stop**, and **step** values.

### **2. `for` Loop with `range(stop)`**

The simplest form is using only the `stop` value. Here, `start` is automatically `0`.

#### **Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

**Output:**

```
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
Done
```

Explanation: The loop variable `i` takes values from `0` to `4` (not including `5`), and prints each one.

---

### **3. `for` Loop with `range(start, stop)`**

Here, we specify both the starting and stopping values.

#### **Example:**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

**Output:**

```
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
Done
```

Explanation: The loop starts from `1` and ends at `5` (`6` is not included).

---

### **4. `for` Loop with `range(start, stop, step)`**

Now we include the `step` value to define how much the loop variable increases on each iteration.

#### **Example:**

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

**Output:**

```
1  
3  
5  
7  
9  
Done
```

Explanation: The loop starts at `1`, adds `2` on each iteration, and stops before reaching `10`.

### **5. Points to Remember**

Here are some important things to keep in mind about the `range()` function:

1. **Only Integer Arguments**:
   The `range()` function only works with integers. You cannot use floating-point numbers.

2. **Arguments Can Be Negative**:
   All three arguments — start, stop, and step — can be either positive or negative.

3. **Step Cannot Be Zero**:
   The step value **cannot** be `0`. Doing so will raise a `ValueError`, as there would be no progress in the sequence.

---

### **Conclusion**

To summarize, the `range()` function is very useful for generating number sequences and is commonly used with `for` loops to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
