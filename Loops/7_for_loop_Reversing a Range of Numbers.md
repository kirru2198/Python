**Presentation: Reversing a Range of Numbers in Python**

Hello everyone,
In this presentation, we will explore how to reverse a range of numbers in Python. We will discuss two approaches:

1. Reversing a range of numbers using a **negative step value**.
2. Reversing a range of numbers using the **`reversed()`** function.

Let's get started!

### **Reversing a Range of Numbers Using a Negative Step Value**

We can reverse a range of numbers using a negative step value in the `range()` function combined with a `for` loop. Let’s understand this with an example.

---

#### **Example: Printing Numbers from 5 to 1**

Suppose we want to print the numbers from 5 down to 1. We can achieve this using the following `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

Let’s break this down:

* The `range(5, 0, -1)` generates a sequence starting from 5, going down to 1.
* The **start value** is 5, the **stop value** is 0 (but 0 is not included), and the **step value** is -1, indicating that we want to decrease the values by 1 with each iteration.

---

#### **Execution Process**

1. **First iteration**: `i = 5`. The number 5 is printed.
2. **Second iteration**: `i = 4`. The number 4 is printed.
3. **Third iteration**: `i = 3`. The number 3 is printed.
4. **Fourth iteration**: `i = 2`. The number 2 is printed.
5. **Fifth iteration**: `i = 1`. The number 1 is printed.

Once the loop completes, the program prints `"Done"` outside of the loop.

#### **Final Output**

```
5
4
3
2
1
Done
```

This is how you can reverse a range of numbers using a negative step value. The negative step ensures that the numbers decrease by 1 until the stop value is reached.

### **Reversing a Range of Numbers Using the `reversed()` Function**

Python also provides the `reversed()` function, which can be used to reverse a sequence. In this case, we can reverse a range of numbers by first generating the range and then passing it to the `reversed()` function.

Let’s see how to do this with the same example of printing numbers from 5 to 1:

```python
for i in reversed(range(1, 6)):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

Here’s what happens:

* The `range(1, 6)` generates numbers from 1 to 5.
* The `reversed()` function reverses this sequence, so it returns the numbers in the opposite order: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
* The `for` loop then prints these values, and after the loop finishes, `"Done"` is printed.

---

#### **Execution Process**

1. The `range(1, 6)` produces numbers from 1 to 5.
2. The `reversed()` function reverses this sequence to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
3. The `for` loop prints each number in the reversed order.
4. After the loop ends, the program prints `"Done"`.

---

#### **Final Output**

```
5
4
3
2
1
Done
```

This is how you can reverse a range of numbers using the `reversed()` function in Python.

### **Conclusion**

We have learned two ways to reverse a range of numbers in Python:

1. Using a **negative step value** in the `range()` function.
2. Using the **`reversed()`** function.

Both methods allow us to print numbers in reverse order effectively.

Thank you for watching this presentation!
I hope the concepts are clear now. I’ll see you in the next one!
