# **Python String Methods – Part 8**

Welcome back! Let's continue our discussion on string methods. This is **Part 8** of the series. In this session, we'll cover two new methods:

1. `index()` method
2. `rindex()` method

After explaining these, we'll also look at a **homework problem** based on these concepts.

## **1. `index()` Method**

The `index()` method returns the **index of the first occurrence** of a given substring in a string. It works **exactly like** the `find()` method, which we discussed in the previous session.

### ✅ Key Difference from `find()`:

* If the substring **is not found**, the `index()` method raises a **`ValueError` exception**.
* In contrast, the `find()` method returns `-1` when the substring is not found.

### 📘 Syntax:

```python
string.index(sub[, start[, end]])
```

* `sub` → The substring to search for (required)
* `start` → The index to start searching from (optional)
* `end` → The index to stop searching (optional)

### 🔍 Example 1:

```python
"Python is a beautiful language".index("e")
```

**Output:** `13`
✔ This is because the first occurrence of `"e"` is at index `13`.

### 🔍 Example 2:

```python
"Python is a beautiful language".index("e", 1, 5)
```

**Output:**
❌ This raises a `ValueError: substring not found` because `"e"` is not found between index `1` and `5` (`"ython"`).

## **2. `rindex()` Method**

The `rindex()` method returns the **index of the last occurrence** of a specified substring in a string. It works like the `rfind()` method.

### ✅ Key Difference from `rfind()`:

* If the substring **is not found**, `rindex()` raises a **`ValueError`**.
* The `rfind()` method, on the other hand, returns `-1` if the substring is not found.

### 📘 Syntax:

```python
string.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])
```

* `sub` → The substring to search for (required)
* `start` → The index to start searching from (optional)
* `end` → The index to stop searching (optional)

### 🔍 Example 1:

```python
"Python is a beautiful language".rindex("e")
```

**Output:** `29`
✔ Because the last occurrence of `"e"` is at index `29`.

### 🔍 Example 2:

```python
"Python is a beautiful language".rindex("e", 1, 5)
```

**Output:**
❌ This raises a `ValueError: substring not found` because `"e"` is not present between index `1` and `5`.

## 🏠 Homework Problem

### 💡 Question:

What will be the output of the following lines of code?

```python
string = "Programming is fun and educational"
print(string.index("a"))
print(string.rindex("a"))
print(string.find("z"))
print(string.rfind("z"))
```

Before running the code, try to analyze it and guess the output on your own.

That concludes our session for today. We have now clearly understood:

* The **`index()` method**
* The **`rindex()` method**
* The differences between `index()`/`find()` and `rindex()`/`rfind()`

Thank you for watching this presentation. I’ll see you in the next one!
