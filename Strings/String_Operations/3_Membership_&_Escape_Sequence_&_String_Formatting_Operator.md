### String Operators in Python

In this presentation, we will continue our discussion on string operators in Python. We will cover three important topics:

1. **Membership Operators**
2. **Escape Sequence Operator**
3. **String Formatting Operator**

Let's dive into each of these topics one by one.

#### Membership Operators

**Membership operators** are used to check whether a value or variable is found within a sequence (such as a string, list, or tuple). There are two membership operators in Python:

1. **`in` Operator**
2. **`not in` Operator**

##### The `in` Operator

The `in` operator is used to check if the first operand is present within the second operand. It returns `True` if the first operand is found within the second operand and `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
# Using 'in' operator
print('just' in 'JustBreathe')  # Returns True because 'just' is a substring of 'JustBreathe'
print('P' in 'JustBreathe')  # Returns True because 'P' is present in 'JustBreathe'
print('PTA' in 'JustBreathe')  # Returns False because 'PTA' is not a substring
```

##### The `not in` Operator

The `not in` operator is the opposite of the `in` operator. It returns `True` if the first operand is **not** contained within the second operand and `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
# Using 'not in' operator
print('just' not in 'JustBreathe')  # Returns False because 'just' is in 'JustBreathe'
print('PTA' not in 'JustBreathe')  # Returns True because 'PTA' is not a substring
```

#### Escape Sequence Operator

The **escape sequence operator** is used to insert characters that are not allowed in a string. These characters are represented by a backslash (`\`) followed by a character or a combination of characters.

An **escape character** is a combination of the backslash (`\`) and a non-allowed character, which allows the insertion of special characters into a string.

For example, we can use escape characters to insert quotation marks or new lines into strings.

Example:

```python
# Using escape characters
print("I am Just Breathe and I am from \"India\"")  # Escapes the quotes within the string
```

Common escape characters include:

* `\n`: Newline
* `\b`: Backspace
* `\t`: Tab
* `\\`: Backslash
* `\ooo`: Octal value
* `\xhh`: Hexadecimal value

Example:

```python
# Using some escape characters
print("I am Just Breathe\nand I am from India")  # Adds a newline
print("I am Just Breathe\tand I am from India")  # Adds a tab
```

Hereâ€™s an example with hexadecimal and octal values:

```python
# Hexadecimal and octal representation
print("I am Just Breathe\x66rom India")  # 'f' from hexadecimal '66'
print("I am Just Breathe\141rom India")  # 'a' from octal '141'
```

In this case:

* `\x66` represents the hexadecimal value `66`, which corresponds to the character `'f'`.
* `\141` represents the octal value `141`, which corresponds to the character `'a'`.

#### String Formatting Operator

The **string formatting operator** is used to format strings dynamically. It allows us to insert values into a string.

There are several format specifiers in Python:

* `%d`: Decimal (integer)
* `%c`: Character
* `%s`: String
* `%f`: Floating-point number

To use the string formatting operator, we include placeholders in the string (such as `%d`, `%s`, etc.), and the actual value is inserted at runtime.

Example:

```python
# Using string formatting operator
age = 28
print("My age is %d" % age)  # Inserts the value of 'age' into the string
```

We can also use multiple format specifiers:

```python
# Multiple format specifiers
name = "John"
height = 5.9
print("Name: %s, Height: %.1f meters" % (name, height))  # '%.1f' for one decimal place
```

Here:

* `%s` is used to insert a string (`name`).
* `%.1f` is used to insert a floating-point number with one decimal place (`height`).

### Conclusion

In this presentation, we have covered the following string operators in Python:

1. **Membership Operators (`in` and `not in`)**: Used to check if a value exists within a string.
2. **Escape Sequence Operator**: Allows us to insert special characters (like newlines, tabs, and quotes) into strings.
3. **String Formatting Operator**: Enables us to dynamically insert values into strings using format specifiers.

These operators are essential tools for handling and manipulating strings in Python. I hope this explanation helps clarify how these operators work.
