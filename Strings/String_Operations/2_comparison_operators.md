### What Are String Comparison Operators?

**String comparison operators** are used to compare two strings in Python. These operators are binary operators, meaning they require two operands (the strings to be compared). In this presentation, we will explore the different types of string comparison operators in Python.

#### Important Points to Remember:

1. **Comparisons Are Case-Sensitive**: In Python, comparisons are case-sensitive, meaning a capital letter is not considered the same as its lowercase counterpart. For example, `A` is different from `a`.
2. **ASCII Values Are Compared**: Each character in a string has an associated **ASCII value**, and it is the ASCII values that are compared, not the characters themselves. For example:

   * The ASCII value of `A` is 65.
   * The ASCII value of `a` is 97.

   This means that `A` is considered less than `a` because 65 is less than 97.

#### ASCII Values to Remember:

* Uppercase letters have lower ASCII values than lowercase letters. For example, `A < a`.
* The ASCII values are incremental. For example, if `a` has an ASCII value of 97, `b` will have 98, and so on.

Now that we have a basic understanding, let's go through the different string comparison operators available in Python.

### 1. Equality Operator (`==`)

The equality operator (`==`) returns `True` if two strings are exactly the same, otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Example:

```python
print("hello" == "hello")  # Output: True
print("hello" == "Hello")  # Output: False
```

In the second case, the comparison returns `False` because the first string starts with a lowercase "h" while the second string starts with an uppercase "H", making the comparison case-sensitive.

### 2. Not Equal Operator (`!=`)

The not equal operator (`!=`) returns `True` if two strings are not equal, and `False` if they are equal.

#### Example:

```python
print("hello" != "hello")  # Output: False
print("hello" != "world")  # Output: True
```

In this example, the first comparison returns `False` because both strings are identical, while the second comparison returns `True` because the strings are different.

### 3. Less Than Operator (`<`)

The less than operator (`<`) returns `True` if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second string, based on their ASCII values.

#### Example:

```python
print("hello" < "world")  # Output: True
print("apple" < "banana")  # Output: True
```

The comparison is case-sensitive, and in this case, `h` (ASCII value 104) is less than `w` (ASCII value 119), so `"hello"` is considered less than `"world"`.

### 4. Less Than or Equal to Operator (`<=`)

The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) returns `True` if the first string is either smaller or equal to the second string.

#### Example:

```python
print("hello" <= "hello")  # Output: True
print("apple" <= "banana")  # Output: True
```

In this case, the comparison returns `True` when both strings are the same. Even if the strings are equal, the "less than or equal" condition is satisfied.

### 5. Greater Than Operator (`>`)

The greater than operator (`>`) returns `True` if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string, based on ASCII values.

#### Example:

```python
print("world" > "hello")  # Output: True
print("banana" > "apple")  # Output: True
```

Here, `w` (ASCII value 119) is greater than `h` (ASCII value 104), so `"world"` is considered greater than `"hello"`.

### 6. Greater Than or Equal to Operator (`>=`)

The greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) returns `True` if the first string is either greater or equal to the second string.

#### Example:

```python
print("hello" >= "hello")  # Output: True
print("world" >= "hello")  # Output: True
```

Even if the strings are equal, the "greater than or equal" condition is satisfied. Similarly, if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second, it will return `True`.

### Conclusion

We have now covered the six main string comparison operators in Python:

1. **Equality (`==`)**
2. **Not Equal (`!=`)**
3. **Less Than (`<`)**
4. **Less Than or Equal (`<=`)**
5. **Greater Than (`>`)**
6. **Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)**

These operators allow you to compare strings based on their lexicographical order and ASCII values. Remember that Python comparisons are case-sensitive, and each character in the string is compared based on its ASCII value.

This concludes the lecture on string comparison operators. Thank you for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next presentation!
